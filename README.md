# Project Title and Description:
## United States income distribution
Throughout this project we analyze the income distribution around the United States, especially for the AANHPI communities. We investigate factors such as marital status and professional industry of work to better understand the income distribution spread. Furthermore, we understand how this has changed between the 1990s to 2020s and compare this income distribution again stately average wages and minimum wages.  By understanding the wealth and income distribution around the US, especially for the AANHPI communities we are able to allocate funds to communities in need.
